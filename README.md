## Josh Coward, Ryan Pacheco, Sajia Zafreen

##Run
1) Run `pip install -r requriments.txt`
2) Open text_summerization.ipynb using jupyter notebook
3) Run the first cell to import libaries
4) If you want to run and fine tune the BERT model proceed with running the second cell, following instructions in the notebook
**NOTE** Fine tuning takes a long time on CPU
5) To only look at pre-trained model comparisons go to `Pre trained comp` heading
6) Datasets will be loaded and cleaned. If you wish to use more datasets go to: https://huggingface.co/datasets?filter=task_ids:summarization,languages:en for a list of datasets that can be loaded using the `datasets` library
7) Run the subsequent cells following instructions in the notebook
